/*
SYSTEM CONTEXT:
This is a healthcare check-in system called HealthGate.

The backend uses Firebase Realtime Database with this fixed structure:

patients/{patientId}
- name: string
- pin: string
- active: boolean

credentials/rfid/{rfidUid}
- patientId: string
- enabled: boolean

arrivals/{arrivalId}
- patientId: string
- timestamp: number (milliseconds)
- deviceId: string
- method: "rfid" | "qr"

IMPORTANT RULES:
- RFID UID is NOT a patient ID.
- RFID UID is a credential that maps to a patientId.
- The website manages credentials.
- The ESP32 device only reads credentials and writes arrivals.
- Patients cannot manage credentials.

All code must follow this model exactly.
